My recently finished master thesis dealt with the subject of gradient boosting models applied to a dataset scraped from [www.strava.com](strava.com). A scraper written in *C#* was used to collect over 60.000 observations of training exercises from professional bicycle athletes. A diagram of the scraper is added below.
